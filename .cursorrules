# Cursor Rules for aa-io/site

## Code Cleanup & Refactoring
**CRITICAL**: When making changes to code, always identify and remove/cleanup any elements that become unnecessary or redundant as a result of the changes. Don't just add new functionality - actively look for what can be simplified or removed.

This includes:
- Removing unused imports, variables, functions, or components
- Simplifying conditional logic that becomes redundant
- Cleaning up CSS classes or styles that are no longer needed
- Removing dead code paths
- Consolidating duplicate logic
- Optimizing component structure when functionality changes

## General Coding Standards
- Use TypeScript with strict typing
- Follow React best practices and hooks patterns
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling with the configured design system
- Implement proper error handling and loading states
- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Use semantic HTML and ensure accessibility

## Component Guidelines
- Keep components focused and single-purpose
- Use composition over prop drilling
- Implement proper TypeScript interfaces for props
- Follow shadcn/ui patterns for UI components
- Use proper React patterns (forwardRef, memo when needed)

## Performance & Optimization
- Remove unused dependencies and imports
- Optimize bundle size by cleaning up unnecessary code
- Use proper React optimization techniques when needed
- Ensure responsive design and mobile-first approach
