At this point it’s not too controversial to say it.

We started in 2017.

- We’d connect to your bank(s) where you get paid
- We’d identify your income, no matter how messy, and divvy it up the way you set up at a “normal” job. 
- We did the stuff
- Every quarter, we’d submit those quarterly tax payments
- We’d open SEP IRA
- We’d enroll in health & dental at the lowest price 



It was a true zero to one. 3 bank contracts. Standing up an RIA and an insurance brokerage. Passing exams. Trying to hire during ’21-’22. 2 years for EDE approval. Learning too many lessons the hardest way possible.

We did YC, raised a few rounds from some great folks, and we had a good run. 

But in early ’23, we had no choice but to shut it down [^1]

The things we built proved popular to copy– [Gusto](https://twitter.com/CatchKristen/status/1321212601947312133?s=20&t=9p3X1Eh_DQ_jtbP57t2NzA), [Square](https://squareup.com/us/en/banking), [Wealthfront](https://www.wealthfront.com/blog/meet-autopilot-a-new-service-that-automates-your-savings-strategy/), [Found](https://found.com/taxes/), [Wingspan](https://www.wingspan.app/platform/contractor-benefits), Lance, [Acorns](https://support.acorns.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500001694582-What-is-Smart-Deposit-), [Qapital](https://www.qapital.com/budgeting/), [Thatch](https://thatch.ai), and eventually [Cash App](https://twitter.com/fintechkristen/status/1726992634961658236?s=46&t=zA8dRezFEPph9WhUIpbQBA) by Kristen herself. [Stride](https://www.stridehealth.com) rebranded in a Catch direction.

We met a lot of amazing people along the way (https://catch.co/creatour)

We built a lot that never saw the light of day– HSAs, ICHRAs, SEP IRAs, contractor benefits, invoicing, an API. Our team continues to advise in multiple industries.

AB5, Prop 22, SECURE, COVID, ACA, EFTPS, RIA, IAR, SEC, FINRA, OCC

### A real postmortem will never get written. But here are some loose personal thoughts:

- Like other first-time founders before us (and inevitably after us), we refused to pick a customer. It (in a way that is only now painfully obvious) not only inserted a factor of uncertainty in the PDLC, but tainted every decision we made. 
- We structured our revenue expectations to balance insurance commissions with float on balances, and we were far too slow to adapt when interest rates went to zero. We were also too quick to undervalue what we built– primarily in making it all free starting Jan ’22.
- (and TBH–) We were just far too sluggish in shipping in ~2018-21.
- The nature of our offering meant we were pretty reliant on third-parties (banks, brokerages, CMS, etc), and we got burned hard once or twice.
- The entire business was cyclical – and particularly with OE in November, underperforming set the pace for the next year without a ton of room to budge. One the enrollments were locked in during OE, we couldn’t easily nudge MoM until the next cycle.

### What we did really well:

- We became the only U.S. consumer company to ever build capability (and required approvals for) banking, tax payment filing, investment advisory (retirement), and insurance enrollment (health+dental). We did it with a tight, focused team not afraid to Do The Stuff.
- We became ruthlessly efficient in building apps. With React Native Web, we supported web, iOS, and Android. Lexi and I shipped daily to all three platforms. Yes, RN is a pain in the ass.
- I know it’s become unpopular to praise GraphQL, but in what we did, it was a pretty good fit.
- We build damn good predictions and automation around income.
- We built on 3 different banks (no, not by choice).
- We built wildly good internal tooling (and probably spent far too much time on it).
- We pushed the envelope on what was possible with EDE more than anyone else has to date (including building the only federal insurance enrollment mobile app)[^2].
- We saved individuals thousands of dollars every year, across both savings on health insurance and quarterly tax payments
- The team did whatever was needed at every step. Multiple engineers passed the MA insurance licensure exam. I passed the Series 65. 
- We got great partnerships– Square, DoorDash, Upwork. Fiverr, Patreon
- We probably had the tightest annual NIST 800-53 audit ever run[^3]
- We maxed out at ~22 people, across all functions

There are versions of this story that work, but this wasn’t one of them.


This whole space needs something. 

It wasn’t us. But it will happen.

Catch [lives on](https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/19/catch-health-insurance-gig-workers-relaunches/) in name, now focused specifically on health insurance[^4]
