          I&rsquo;m Andrew Ambrosino—a builder who refuses to choose between craft and scale. I&rsquo;ve spent the last
          decade turning thorny problems into products that feel inevitable: co‑founding{' '}
          <span className="font-medium">Catch</span> (YC W19, acquired), leading product at{' '}
          <span className="font-medium">Noyo</span>, and shaping design systems that power billions of dollars in
          employee‑benefit transactions. My sweet spot is the intersection of API rigor, elegant front‑end architecture,
          and the kind of user experience that disappears into the background while real business happens.

        <p>
          Today I head Design & Frontend Architecture at <span className="font-medium">Noyo</span>, where we&rsquo;re
          rewriting how health‑insurance data moves across the industry. I work shoulder‑to‑shoulder with engineers and
          carriers to make sure the pipes are tight, the pixels are right, and the business model actually sings. I also
          write (sometimes loudly) about product strategy, AI agents, and why TypeScript is the lingua franca of
          ambitious teams.

          I split my time between Cambridge and a small town north of Boston, where two imaginative daughters keep me
          honest about what &ldquo;user‑friendly&rdquo; really means. If you&rsquo;re building something complex that
          ought to feel simple—or you just want to debate the proper ratio of mezcal to lime—drop me a line.
